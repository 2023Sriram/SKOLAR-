VISUAL STUDIO CODE 
IDE Selection Choose a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from the 
following options: 
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Jupyter Notebook. 
Install the selected IDE on your computer.
Both Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Jupyter Notebook are excellent options for Python 
development, but they serve slightly different purposes. Here’s a brief comparison to help 
you decide:
• Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Pros
➢ Powerful and versatile editor with extensive language support.
➢ Rich ecosystem of extensions for debugging, linting, version control, and more.
➢ Integrated terminal and support for remote development.
➢ Good for larger projects and general-purpose coding.
Cons 
➢ Slightly steeper learning curve for beginners.
➢ Requires configuration for optimal use.
• Jupyter Notebook
Pros
➢ Excellent for data science, machine learning, and educational purposes.
➢ Interactive and visual, making it great for exploratory data analysis.
➢ Easy to use for beginners.
➢ Allows for mixing of code, markdown, and visualizations.
Cons 
➢ Not as suitable for larger, production-level projects.
➢ Less support for non-Python languages.
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS 
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
1. Download: Go to the [official VS Code website] Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined
(https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. Install: Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. Python Extension: After installation, open VS Code and install the Python extension from 
the Extensions marketplace.
Jupyter Notebook
1. Anaconda Distribution: The easiest way to install Jupyter Notebook is through the 
Anaconda distribution, which includes Jupyter and many other useful packages.
2. Download: Go to the [Anaconda website]
(https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) GETTING STARTED WITH ANACONDA 
INDIVIDUAL EDITION and download the installer for your operating system.
3. Install: Run the installer and follow the instructions.
Launch Jupyter Notebook
Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook from there. Alternatively, you can 
install Jupyter Notebook using pip if you already have “Python installed”:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the command: pip install notebook
3. After installation, start Jupyter Notebook by running the command: jupyter notebook
❖ Both tools are valuable, but the best choice depends on your specific needs and 
workflow. 
❖ If you’re still undecided, you might consider starting with Jupyter Notebook for its 
ease of use and interactive nature, especially if you’re focusing on data science or 
learning Python. 
❖ You can always install and use both as they complement each other well
